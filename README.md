- 👋 Hi, I’m Waleed 
- 👀 I’m interested in Image Processing, Machine Learning and Robotics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Image processing and deep learning using Python, OpenCV, keras and Tensorflow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which are aimed towards computer vision using Python, but I also have experience in C++ and open for colabs on that as well.
